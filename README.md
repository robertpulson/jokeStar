# comedy-test

The purpose of this tech test is to design a new website for the Comedy Store. The website must have the following features:

* Single Page
* User Log In
* Page shows random joke
* Random joke is different everytime, until limit of jokes is reached
* Display dates of upcoming comedy store events

I have decided to use Angular JS for this task, which will mean working with the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node) for the first time.

# Progress so far

* Set up angular
* Added Node
* Added Express
* Added Mongo/Mongoose - Realised that the MEAN stack is pretty mean and is going to take a lot of working out. However Im making progress and will complete this project by the end of the week.
