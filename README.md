A social media website using the MEAN stack.

# Progress so far

* Set up angular
* Added Node
* Added Express
* Added Mongo and Mongoose - Realised that the MEAN stack is pretty mean and is going to take a lot of working out. However Im making progress and will complete this project by the end of the week.
* Changed jade for ejs. In retrospect I now see the value of Jade, however at this point I'm finding the amount of new technology overwhelming and am using ejs to minify this.
* MEAN stack now up and running. Users can register, login and signout. Users can only view the home page if they are signed in and will be re-directed when they sign out. When on the homepage users will see a random joke.
