A project using the MEAN stack.

The MEAN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, Angular JS and Node. This was the first time I had used all of these technologies together, and the first time I had used MongoDB.

I have managed to get a basic social media website up and running. Users can signup, login and logout. While signed in they can make new posts, and rate other posts. I even incorporated a rating system for users and done some work on the front end styling with bootstrap.
